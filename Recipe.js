1. In an eggless tiramisu recipe, the tiramisu filling is made by making a smooth mixture of whipped mascarpone cheese, whipped cream, powdered sugar and vanilla extract.

2. The sponge fingers or sponge cake slices are dipped in coffee syrup. These are then layered in a glass pan or bowl. Now the mascarpone cheese+whipped cream filling mixture is spread evenly on the sponge fingers. 

3. In a similar way 1 to 2 more layers of the coffee syrup soaked sponge fingers and mascarpone cheese+whipped cream are made. 
4. The top layer is of the mascarpone cheese+whipped cream which is dusted with some cocoa powder. 

5. The tiramisu is ready now and has to be refrigerated for 4 to 5 hours or overnight for it to set. After the tiramisu is set, you can slice it and serve as a dessert.
